# noirelight2-commands

These are the commands for my chatbot https://github.com/noiredayz/noirelight2

## how2use ##
1. Clone this repo in the bots directory. I suggest using the "commands-available" directory.
2. In the bots directory create a "commands-enabled" directory
3. Symlink commands from the available directory to the enabled directory to enable them

## compatibility ##
These code files will only work with nlt2 v0.5.0

## reporting issues or requesting new commands/functions ##
You can open an issue or message me on twitch.
